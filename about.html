            <p>Kay Bank Limited was set up as a family bank in 1993, before evolving into one of the nation's most trusted financial institutions. The presence of Kay Bank Limited in the banking industry in Ghana over the last twenty-eight years has galvanized banking onto a higher performance level where competition and innovation in responding to the needs of the customer have become the driving force of the industry. In a world where nothing stands still, Kay Bank now occupies an environment with more intense competition and higher consumer expectation than ever before. However, we embrace this challenge and are commited to giving the best of services to the general public.</p>
